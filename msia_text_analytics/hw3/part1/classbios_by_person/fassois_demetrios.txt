I was born in Michigan but raised in Greece, where I obtained my bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Industrial Engineering at the University of Patras. I wrote my thesis in Statistical Process Control as applied to a manufacturing operation. While studying I also worked as a researcher at the Stochastic Mechanical Systems & Automation Laboratory at the University of Patras. I worked on novel air traffic concepts, including aircraft position monitoring and prediction using Statistical Process Control, and Time Series Analysis.  Later on I also worked as a researcher at the Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems & Automation at the University of Patras, on a project focusing on software applications for advanced manufacturing. It was through these experiences that I discovered my interest in analytics and decided to further explore the field in the MSiA program at Northwestern. Im taking the text analytics class because Im also very interested in the application of analytics for text analysis and because it has become a very desirable skill to have too. I have a strong interest in statistical data analysis methods and their uses in business operations and I strongly believe in the value of data analysis and data-based decision making. Upon graduation, I want to specialize in the predictive analytics and machine learning field. I would prefer to work in the tech industry and I look forward to extend my career in the data science field.

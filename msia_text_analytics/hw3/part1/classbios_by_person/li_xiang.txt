My name is Xiang Li. I am originally from Chongqing, China. I did my undergrad at Purdue University and recently graduated at summer 2014. At Purdue University, I participated in a case competition within the School of Management as a teams data analyst. The competition enables us to address real-world problems for an ice-cream company and maximizing clients profit and market share. It was also the important project that I discovered that my passion lies in data analysis. After then, I decided to pursue a master in data analysis and found the MSiA program. Before this program, I did my undergraduate studies at Purdue University. I participated in a Hackathon. The Project we did was about sentiment analysis and analyzing relationship between article quality and positive review by audiences. It was a simple text analysis project. Therefore, I want to dive deeper in text analytics and get to know more techniques. My 3 year plan is to become a excellent data scientist. Let us just have fun!

Alejandro Herrera- from Bogota, Colombia- I want to help business grow using analytics and I came to the program to have a technical foundation to do so.- Before the program I worked in a management consulting group within Schlumberger, the oilfield services company. I focused on strategy and operations related projects. I helped internal and external clients- I became interested in text analytics when I read a news story about a trading firm that uses sentiment analysis to make their business decisions.- Plans for the future are to be a world class business man

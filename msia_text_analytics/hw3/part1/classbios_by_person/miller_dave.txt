Born and raised in MN, but a California transplant since '99.  I graduated from UC Berkeley (Go Bears!) in 2001 with a degree in chemical engineering with an emphasis in biotech.  I spent a few years as an engineering consultant in the biotech industry, and then  after gradually turning from hobby to passion - in 2005 I made the jump to become a full-time Professional Poker Player.  I played poker mostly online, and in 2011 the government (effectively) shut down online poker in the US.  Knowing that I didn't want to go back into engineering for a career, I did some soul searching, and with the help of a friend discovered data science.  I took some courses on Coursera to see if this field would be something that I would enjoy and would be intellectually stimulating, and after really liking the coursework, started to apply to grad school programs.  I got accepted into the MSiA 2014-2015 cohort at Northwestern and the rest is history.  

I tend to do a lot of research when it comes to purchases, so naturally I have an interest in consumer analytics.  My medium term goal is to start up my own company in consumer analytics.  I have a growing list of ideas and hope to one day see (at least) one of them come to fruition.  A couple of my ideas would require text analytics (one very much so), and that is what has led me to Text Analytics as an elective.  I also could have used text analytics in my internship, and would like to have it as another skill in my arsenal as a data scientist. 

I work to live (not live to work), so I aim to be able to have a good work-life balance where I can still travel the world and go on new adventures.

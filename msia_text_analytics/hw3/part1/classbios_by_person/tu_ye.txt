I am originally from Wuhan, the most populous city in Central China. I came to the United States to pursue an undergraduate education in 2009. I studied Accounting and Finance at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign (UIUC).
While an undergrad at UIUC, I served as a research assistant in the College of Business. In one Finance research group, my team needed to handle noisy stock transaction data. I took the initiative and developed a VBA program to clear the noises in the dataset and classify companies based on their IPO dates.I really enjoyed this experience of cleaning and analyzing data, as well as solving obstacles throughout the process. Thus, I decided to take advanced math and statistics courses, and to pursue a computer science minor. 
During my college years, I developed a strong interest in data analysis and statistical learning, so I decided to apply for the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern. After graduating in December 2013, I started to work at an IT startup company, Cazoodle Inc., located in Champaign, IL. I designed and developed a customer relation system for the business team using Google script, a special version of Java Script.
Text analytics is an essential part of data analytics, since we are surrounding by tons of text data. The internet generate tremendous amount of text data daily in the format of news, reviews, and comments. I am interested to learn how to derive high-quality information from text and to explore the field of natural language processing. Thus, I choose text analytics as my elective.  
I am excited to gain more experience with large-scale data and take my analytical skills to the next level through completing the Master of Science in Analytics program. I am looking forward to working as a data scientist and exploring the diverse opportunities in this fast growing field.

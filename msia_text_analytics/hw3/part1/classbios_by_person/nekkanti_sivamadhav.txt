I am from a small coastal town in south India. I graduated from IIT Madras in 2012 where I majored in Biotechnology.  I started my career with Cognizant Technology Solutions in their Analytics group where I worked with top pharmaceutical companies in the world in projects related to optimizing salesforce effort. After spending a year at Cognizant, I worked at an analytics consulting Start-up Company where I took on bigger responsibilities and worked on multiple challenging projects in various domains. I believe that the role of analytics will continue to grow and will soon become an integral part of every product and service. I felt the need to continue on the path of learning. I wanted to learn various statistical techniques and cutting edge technologies in depth. I like to work on stimulating and exciting problems. I think text analytics is very interesting and opens up new avenues to solve real life problems that werent easy to tackle before.

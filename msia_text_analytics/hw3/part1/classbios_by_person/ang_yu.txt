I originally comes from Mainland China and graduated from the University of Minnesota  Twin Cities with a BA in statistics and a BSB in finance. During my undergraduate studies, I started the journey from finance and explored my interests in other business analytics fields.
I have my main focus on financial analytics and has interned with commercial and investment banks. In my senior year, I worked as a fixed income analyst at Carlson Funds Enterprise, where I took care of the consumer non-cyclical sector. I developed financial models, compared bonds, and updated earning reports to monitor credit qualities. During the last semester, I began to work as an analytics intern at Allen Edmonds. As a part of an e-commerce team, I supported the department director in product expansions, inventory, search engine, and shopping site optimizations. 
I became interested in text analytics during the first quarter at MSiA program where we need to parse text from resume. I found the importance and fun of text analytics.
Through my internships, I realized the potential and need of analytics. As a graduate student in the Analytics program at Northwestern, I am excited to learn the applications of analytics in industry, where I can predict, optimize, and visualize data to provide business solutions.

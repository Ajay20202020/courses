I am originally from Cincinnati, Ohio. I enrolled in MSIA because of some experiences I had while working at Proctor & Gamble as a product researcher. I noticed that we collected lots of data, but there werent many people who could actually process and make sense of it. Prior to enrolling at Northwestern, I completed a PhD in experimental psychology. My research focused on the connection between perception, memory, and decision-making. My interest in text analytics began while I was conducting research, as I often had to parse key words from open-ended response questions. The process of extracting meaning from text turned out to be a lot more challenging (and interesting) than I had believed at the outset. Upon graduation, Ill be working at Nike WHQ in Beaverton, OR as a data scientist. I worked at Nike over the summer and it was a really fun place to be. Im looking forward to returning in January.

Brought up in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Ameer moved to his home country India to study Computer Science at the National Institute of Technology, Warangal. He developed a passion for machine learning during his undergraduate years through his internship at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, as well as on-campus research work. This interest inspired him to pursue an M.S. degree in Computer Science from KAUST, Saudi Arabia  a university as much devoted to technological innovation as it is to bringing social change in the conservative country.

After graduating, Ameer joined SABIC, a leading petrochemicals manufacturer, as a business intelligence analyst. During his two-and-a-half year stint, he designed data quality metrics and reports for key corporate functions, and led a cross-functional team to perform quantitative analysis of plant maintenance data for SABICs methanol unit, resulting in improved data quality and operational efficiency. Developing dynamic reports for a working capital optimization project, Ameer realized how descriptive analysis enabled efficient cash management across the organization. His motivation to seek a career in big data stems from its potential to transform the way businesses are run through informed decision making.

Through the MSiA program, Ameer seeks to develop skills in statistical modeling and data visualization. He is looking towards a career in the technology industry as a data scientist or in the consulting business as an analytics practitioner upon completion of the program.

Ameer's interest in text analytics stems from the explosion of interest in unstructured data emerging from social media and other platforms that can be augmented to provide more robust decision making, especially around marketing and customer analytics.

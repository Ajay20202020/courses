My name is Shiyi Chen, originally from Chengdu, China. When I was in high school, I was so eager to see the world. Therefore, after I graduated, I went to Beijing for college. Initially I was in Economics but I was not sure about it. In the beginning of my third year, I had an opportunity to come to the U.S. as an exchange student at University of Colorado Denver. I seized the opportunity to explore my passion and talents by taking a variety of classes. With 70% scholarship, I studied abroad with Semester at Sea in 7 Mediterranean countries and there I tried philosophy and global studies. During my undergraduate years, I also worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant.  After all these extensive experiences, I realized a quantitative and computational field would be the best fit for me. My internship experiences with WealthTouch and Markit data solutions team reinforced my belief. I entered into MSiA program in September 2014. Finally I am pursuing something fancy and hot in the industry, big data and I have enjoyed it.I became interested in text analytics when Glassdoor contacted me about an internship position and asked me to do a text classification assignment. Back then I have signed contract with Motorola Mobility though Glassdoor project is interesting to me but I had no idea how to do it. During my summer intern, I encountered a mobile app categorization problem, which essentially is the same with the Glassdoor project. I had to educate myself through basic concepts and a couple of classification methods. Eventually I developed my own algorithm for the app categorization problem. The experience gave me one example of how text analytics can be tremendously helpful in real world business. Now I want to embrace it.In the future, I aim to be a domain expert in data science. I would want to focus my job on modeling problems and visualizing data.

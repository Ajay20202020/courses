I am originally from an area called the Quad Cities, which is a very small
metropolitan area on the Mississippi River that includes cities in both Illinois
and Iowa. It is, I think, the only place that the Mississippi River runs
east-west. After graduating with a computer science degree from Bradley
University in Peoria, Illinois, I moved to Chicago to work as a software
developer. I became interested in pursuing a career that focused more on the
human elements of computing, so I left that job to pursue a Master's degree in
Information Architecture from Illinois Tech. It was during that time that I
became interested in continuing to do research into socio-technical systems,
which is how I ended up in the Technology and Social Behavior PhD program at
Northwestern. Given that I primarily study communication behavior on social
media platform, text analytics is an important methodology to me. While a lot of
research in my field focuses on qualitative methods, I think natural language
processing and text mining provides an alternative way to make sense of the
massive amount of data generated by social media sites. I think there are a lot
of interesting questions in this area that I could continue to pursue in an
academic career, but I also know a lot of people in my field end up in user
research roles in industry.

Originally from a small town in central New England, Mike graduated from Brandeis University in 2007, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree while completing a double major in Mathematics and Physics. In addition to his academics, during his time at Brandeis, Mike was also a four-year member of the Mens Varsity Soccer Team. Since completing his undergrad, Mike has experience as both an actuary and a professional online poker player. He began his actuarial career as an analyst in the Boston ofce of Milliman, an actuarial consulting rm. At Milliman, he employed mathematical and statistical methods to help build predictive models used primarily in support of reserve analyses for clients across a wide range of different industries. Mike has also worked as an analyst for John Hancock Financial, where he used similar techniques to estimate nancial reserves for John Hancocks variable annuities block of business. He has also passed Actuarial Exams P and FM.As an online poker player, Mike identied concepts from probability theory, combinatorics, inductive reasoning, and game theory that are relevant to card games, and integrated them to produce strategies that gave him an advantage over his opponents. While his undergraduate degree approached mathematics and statistics from a more theoretical standpoint, Mike was drawn to Northwesterns MSiA due to the applied nature of the program. He was especially attracted to the way it combines classroom study with industry supplied projects. He is looking forward to learning computational techniques such as data mining and machine learning, and hopes that combining these skills with his mathematics background will allow him to more effectively address a wider range of real-world problems. Broadly speaking, he is particularly interested in the way that data and analytics can be used to benet the social good.
